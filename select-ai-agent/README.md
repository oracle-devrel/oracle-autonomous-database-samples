# About Select AI Agent

**Select AI Agent** - a feature of **Oracle Autonomous AI Database** - extends Select AI with an autonomous agent framework that lets you build, deploy, and manage AI agents directly in the database. It enables agentic workflows that can reason over prompts, use tools, and orchestrate multi-step tasks, all while keeping your data in Autonomous AI Database.

With Select AI Agent, you can reduce development and operational overhead. There is no need to download, install, or manage separate agent frameworks or provision additional compute for orchestration. Database development tooling allows you to define, run, and monitor agents managed entirely by the database.

Because agents run inside **Autonomous AI Database**, data does not need to be shipped to external services for orchestration, which improves security and governance. Select AI Agent respects existing database security concepts such as role-based and code-based access control (RBAC and CBAC), system and object privileges, Virtual Private Database (VPD), Oracle Real Application Security (RAS), data masking, and encryption features.
