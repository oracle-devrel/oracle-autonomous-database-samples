# OCI Object Storage AI Agent & Tools

## 🚀 Overview

The **OCI Object Storage AI Agent** enables natural-language–driven automation and advisory capabilities for **OCI Object Storage**, powered by **Select AI (DBMS_CLOUD_AI_AGENT)**.

This agent allows users to manage buckets, objects, lifecycle policies, retention rules, replication, multipart uploads, and work requests using **conversational instructions**, while enforcing **safety, confirmations, and clarity**.

The design follows a **Tools + Agent + Team** architecture, making it scalable, auditable, and easy to extend.

## 🧠 Why This Object Storage Agent Matters

Traditional Object Storage operations require:
- Deep knowledge of OCI APIs
- Correct sequencing of multiple steps
- Manual confirmation handling
- Error-prone scripting

This AI agent improves reliability by:
- Understanding user intent before acting
- Prompting only for missing inputs
- Confirming destructive operations explicitly
- Automatically deriving namespace and region context
- Presenting results in human-readable formats

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Oracle Autonomous Database (23ai recommended)
- Select AI enabled
- OCI Object Storage access
- OCI credential or Resource Principal
- ADMIN or equivalent privileged user

---

## ⚙️ Installation – Tools

Run as ADMIN (or privileged user):

```sql
sqlplus admin@db @oci_object_storage_tools.sql
```

> Configuration (credential, region, compartment) can be provided during install or later via `SELECTAI_AGENT_CONFIG`.

### What This Script Does

- Grants required `DBMS_CLOUD` and Select AI privileges
- Creates `OCI_OBJECT_STORAGE_AGENTS` PL/SQL package
- Registers all Object Storage AI tools
- Enables namespace discovery and secure OCI access

---

## 🧩 Available AI Tools (High-Level)

- Cancel work requests

---

## 🤖 Installation – Agent & Team

Run:

```sql
sqlplus admin@db @oci_object_storage_agent.sql
```

### Prompts
- Target schema name
- AI Profile name

### Objects Created

| Object | Name |
|------|------|
| Task | OCI_OBJECTSTORE_TASKS |
| Agent | OCI_OBJECT_STORAGE_ADVISOR |
| Team | OCI_OBJECTSTORE_TEAM |

---

## 🧠 Task Intelligence Highlights

The task enforces:
- Intent detection before execution
- Clarifying questions for incomplete input
- Mandatory confirmation for destructive actions
- Automatic namespace resolution
- Human-readable formatting of outputs
- Safe automation of Object Storage operations

---

## 🧱 Extending & Generalizing the Agent

### Recommended Pattern

**Keep OCI logic inside tools.  
Define behavior in tasks.  
Bind permissions via AI profiles.**

### Example Extensions
- Read-only Object Storage audit agent
- Lifecycle and cost-optimization agent
- Cross-region replication advisor
- Security-focused retention enforcement agent

---

## 🔄 Safe Re-Execution

All scripts are **safe to re-run**:
- Tasks, agents, and teams are dropped and recreated
- No Object Storage resources are modified implicitly
- Destructive actions always require confirmation

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Always confirm bucket and object deletions
- Prefer Resource Principal in OCI environments
- Separate read-only and admin agents
- Use lifecycle rules instead of manual cleanup
- Monitor work requests for long-running operations
