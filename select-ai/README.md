# About Select AI

**Select AI** — a feature of **Oracle Autonomous AI Database** — supports building AI-enabled applications and tools that leverage large language models (LLMs) and transformers from a wide range of AI providers or privately hosted AI models.  

Using SQL, PL/SQL, and Python APIs, Select AI allows you to query data using natural language prompts against your database data, leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for LLM responses grounded in your trusted data sources, and generate synthetic data, among other capabilities.

For natural language-to-SQL (NL2SQL) generation, you can ask questions like:  
*“Show me last quarter’s top-selling products.”*  
Select AI — using your selected LLM — converts the question into SQL and runs it securely against your database. You can view the generated SQL, produce an explanation of each query step, automatically run the query, or receive a natural-language narration of the results.  

Select AI serves as a productivity tool for experienced SQL developers and empowers non-experts to extract insights without needing to understand database schemas or SQL syntax.
